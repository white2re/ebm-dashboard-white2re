## 🛠️ Complete Your Professional Setup (15 minutes)

Now that you've seen your dashboard working, let's make it officially yours and get it online!

### Step 1: Personalize Your Dashboard (2 minutes)
1. **In VS Code**, open `index.html`

5. **Save** the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S) and refresh your browser

### Step 2: Publish to GitHub (10 minutes)

**Why GitHub?** Your dashboard needs to be online for the content to load properly (due to browser security). Plus, employers love seeing GitHub portfolios!

1. **Create GitHub account** at [github.com](https://github.com) (if you don't have one)
2. **Click "New" repository** (green button)
3. **Repository name:** `ebm-dashboard-[your-eID]` (example: `ebm-dashboard-smith21`)
4. **Make it Public** (required for GitHub Pages)
5. **Check "Add a README file"**
6. **Click "Create repository"**

7. **Upload your files:**
   - Click "uploading an existing file" link
   - **Drag your entire MGT357-EBM-Dashboard-Template folder** into the upload area
   - **Important:** Select ALL files inside the folder, including the `content/` folder files
   - Click "Open" - you should see 25+ files listed for upload
   - Add commit message: "Initial dashboard setup"
   - Click "Commit changes"

12. **Verify success:** All your files should now be visible in your repository!

13. **Go to Settings tab** in your repository (top menu bar)
14. **Scroll down to "Pages" section** (in the left sidebar under "Code and automation")

16. **Branch:** Select "main"
17. **Folder:** Select "/ (root)"
18. **Click "Save"**
19. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment
20. **Visit your live dashboard:** 
    `https://[your-eID].github.io/ebm-dashboard-[your-eID]`

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes:

### Step 3: Organize Your Project (2 minutes)
1. **Create a dedicated folder** on your computer: `MGT357-EBM-Project`
2. **Move your template folder** into this new folder
3. **Create a bookmark** to your live dashboard
4. **Bookmark this GitHub repository** - you'll be updating files here all semester

### Step 4: Success Verification (2 minutes)
