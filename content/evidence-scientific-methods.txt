## Research Question
[employee motivation in workplace]



**Primary Research Question:** [What does research tell us about this problem?]
What is the biggest factor that decreases employee motivation?
How does negative social interactions at work affect motivation?
What is the relationship between high workload, negative work environments, and reduced motivation? {consensus}
How do compensation systems (monetary and non-monetary rewards) influence employee motivation and job satisfaction? {consensus}

**Secondary Research Question:** [What does research tell us about potential solutions?]


## Search Strategy

### Databases Searched

- [ ] **Business Source Premier** [For business and management research] 
- [ ] **Google Scholar** [For multidisciplinary academic content]
- [ ] **JSTOR** [For established academic journals]
- [ ] **SSRN** [For business and social science working papers]
- [ ] **Other:** [List additional relevant databases]

### Keywords and Search Terms

#### Primary Keywords
[List main terms related to your problem/solution]
Burnout, Amotivation, Desmotivation, Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation	

#### Secondary Keywords

- **Total Articles Found:** [Number across all databases]
- **After Removing Duplicates:** [Number of unique articles]
- **After Title/Abstract Screening:** [Number meeting basic criteria]
- **Selected for Full Review:** [Final number for detailed analysis]

### Search Documentation
[Keep a record of what you searched and when]

**Date:** [Search date]
**Database:** [Which database]
**Search Terms:** [Exact search string used]

**Notes:** [Any observations about the search]

## Quality Assessment Approach
[How will you evaluate study quality?]

### Research Design Hierarchy
1. **Systematic Reviews/Meta-analyses** [Highest quality]
2. **Randomized Controlled Trials** [High quality]
3. **Quasi-experimental Studies** [Medium-high quality]
4. **Cohort Studies** [Medium quality]
5. **Cross-sectional Studies** [Medium-low quality]
6. **Case Studies** [Lower quality but valuable for context]

### Quality Criteria Checklist
- [ ] Clear research question
- [ ] Appropriate methodology
- [ ] Adequate sample size
- [ ] Valid measurement tools
- [ ] Appropriate statistical analysis
- [ ] Clear reporting of results
- [ ] Discussion of limitations
- [ ] Peer-reviewed publication

## Documentation Process

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be systematic and comprehensive in your approach
2. Document everything so others could replicate your search
3. Focus on research relevant to both your problem AND potential solutions
4. Use library resources and ask librarians for help with database searches
5. Keep detailed records of what you find and why you include/exclude studies
