# Scientific Evidence: 
**Logic Model:** Compensation → Motivation → Job Satisfaction

### Research Conducted
- **Database Used:** Consensus research database for evidence-based insights
- **Keywords Applied:** "Compensation leads to job satisfaction with motivation as a mediator" 
- **Results Found:** Two studies validating compensation → motivation → job satisfaction pathways
- **External Validation:** GSS (General Social Survey) used for benchmarking organizational data against national standards

## Sources Consulted

### Research Evidence Gathered
- **Ghana Commercial Bank Study (N=60):** Banking industry research validating compensation → motivation → job satisfaction relationships, showing human resources practices positively correlate with motivation, compensation, and job satisfaction while negatively correlating with turnover
- **PT. Pelita Satria Perkasa Study (N=120):** Indonesian retail company research demonstrating compensation significantly impacts work motivation, and work motivation mediates the effect of compensation on job satisfaction, supporting the mediation pathway in our logic model
- **GSS National Dataset:** Used for validating organizational compensation-satisfaction correlations against nationally representative data
