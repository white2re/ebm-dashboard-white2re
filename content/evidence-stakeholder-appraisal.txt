# Stakeholder Evidence: Quality Assessment
**Purpose:** Evaluate how credible and useful the stakeholder evidence we collected is

## Sample Representativeness

### Data Overview
- **Target Population:** ~150 relevant stakeholders (leadership, management, employees, HR, finance)
- **Sample Size:** ~45 perspectives captured from secondary sources
- **Coverage Estimate:** ~30% of stakeholders, based on available documents
- **Representativeness:** Medium – good coverage of key decision-makers, but employee voices are underrepresented

### Stakeholder Group Coverage
- **Management:** 40% (target 30%) – slightly overrepresented due to available documentation
- **Employees:** 25% (target 40%) – underrepresented, limited survey access
- **HR/Finance:** 25% (target 20%) – good coverage from analytics and reports
- **External:** 10% (target 10%) – adequate industry benchmark data

### Key Limitations
- Convenience sampling from existing documents favored management perspectives
- Employee feedback mostly comes from formal surveys, missing "silent" or informal voices
- Limited input from high performers and minimal competitor insights

## Bias Assessment (Brief)

**Overall Bias Risk:** Medium

Secondary sources overrepresent management; surveys may under-report dissatisfaction due to social desirability or job security concerns. Historical data may not fully reflect current sentiment.

## Power & Impact Assessment

### Who Can Influence or Block Decisions
- **CEO & VP of HR:** Ultimate decision-makers; support is crucial, lack of it can block change
- **Finance Leadership:** Controls funding, sets ROI expectations, can halt changes if criteria aren't met
- **Department Directors:** Manage daily implementation and resources; influence middle managers
- **Middle Management:** Shape employee experience and adoption during rollout
- **HR Personnel:** Handle system setup, policy design, and consistency
- **Employees:** Limited direct authority, but collective response affects leadership perception

### Who Benefits or Could Be Harmed
**Primary Beneficiaries:** Employees (fairer, transparent pay with performance links), Organization (lower turnover, higher productivity, better recruitment)

**Potential Harm:** Current high performers may lose advantages; HR and management staff face extra workload

**Ethical Considerations:** Transparency can shift power from managers controlling pay; safeguards needed for fair evaluations

## Evidence Credibility & Confidence

### Overall Confidence
**Level:** Medium-Low

**Reasoning:** Secondary evidence gives good directional insights but lacks depth from direct stakeholder input; management perspectives are overrepresented and employee dissatisfaction may be underreported

### Strengths
- Strong coverage of decision-makers (CEO, VP HR, Finance)
- Clear understanding of who can enable or block implementation
- Consistent confirmation that compensation-motivation link is a real issue

### Limitations  
- Limited current employee feedback; silent dissatisfaction may be missing
- Secondary sources may not reflect recent changes in stakeholder attitudes
- Unclear how stakeholders would react to specific changes vs. general support

### Decision-Making Impact
Evidence is good for broad, directional decisions (e.g., improving compensation systems). Not enough for detailed implementation planning — direct stakeholder validation would be needed before committing resources.
