# Problem Definition Framework
## Clear Problem Statement

Core Issue:
This management problem centers on low employee job satisfaction, characterized by:

• Employees showing reluctance to come to work
  - Detailed Impact: Employees do not want to come to work, feeling disconnected from their purpose and undervalued

• Workers feeling dissatisfied with compensation fairness
  - Context: There are 12% pay gaps between employees in similar roles, creating perceived unfairness

• Staff perceiving disconnection between performance and rewards
  - Key Concern: Employees don't see a clear link between their work and their compensation, reducing their sense of value

## X → Y Framework (Current State → Desired State)

### Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?)
Current Problem:
• Low employee job satisfaction
  - Current Situation: Employees are dissatisfied with their jobs, particularly around compensation fairness and transparency
  - Impact: This affects workplace morale, productivity, and retention

• Compensation system lacks transparency
  - No clear connection between performance and pay decisions
  - 12% pay equity gaps across similar roles creating perceived unfairness

• High turnover among dissatisfied employees
  - 34% retention gap between employees satisfied vs. dissatisfied with compensation
  - Increasing absenteeism and declining engagement

### Desired State (Y - What outcome do we want to achieve?)
Target Outcomes:
• Increase employee job satisfaction by 15-25%
  - Specific Goal: Improve satisfaction through transparent, fair compensation system
  - Measurement: Track through employee satisfaction surveys and retention data

• Improve retention by 34% among previously dissatisfied employees
  - Implementation: Address compensation fairness and transparency issues
  - Outcome: Reduce turnover and create more engaged workforce

• Enhance performance outcomes by 28%
  - Goal achievement improvements through increased motivation
  - If surveys and performance data show these improvements, we've effectively addressed the problem


## PICOC Framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Context)
### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)
Key Affected Groups:
• Employees across all levels (N=2,847 in our organization)
  - Particularly those dissatisfied with compensation transparency and fairness
  - Direct effect on daily work experience, motivation, and retention decisions

• Management and leadership
  - Responsible for implementing fair compensation systems and communicating pay decisions
  - Must deal with 34% higher turnover among compensation-dissatisfied employees, increasing recruitment and training costs

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Proposed Solution:
• Transparent, Performance-Linked Compensation System
  - Strategy: Create clear matrix showing how performance connects to compensation, fix 12% pay equity gaps, and train managers on fair evaluations
  - Purpose: Increase job satisfaction by improving employee motivation through fair, transparent compensation
  - Mechanism: When employees see clear performance-pay linkage and fair treatment, motivation increases, which leads to higher job satisfaction

### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
Alternative approaches include career development programs, one-time bonuses, or non-financial recognition. However, evidence shows compensation improvements (r=0.58 with satisfaction) outperform career development alone (r=0.35). Doing nothing will continue 34% retention gaps and declining satisfaction trends.

### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
Success means:
• 15-25% improvement in job satisfaction scores
• 34% improvement in retention among previously dissatisfied employees
• 28% improvement in goal achievement and performance
• Validated pathway showing compensation improvements → increased motivation → higher satisfaction

### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
This applies to organizations where:
• Compensation systems lack transparency about performance-pay connections
• Pay equity gaps exist (our data shows 12% gaps)
• Employees report low satisfaction linked to compensation issues
• Organizational data shows satisfaction-retention connections (our 34% gap)
## Clear Problem Statement
The management problem I want to address is low employee job satisfaction driven by compensation system issues. Employees don't want to come to work because they don't see a fair connection between their performance and their pay. With 12% pay gaps across similar roles and no clear transparency about how compensation decisions are made, employees feel undervalued and unmotivated. This lack of motivation translates directly into low job satisfaction, which shows up in our 34% higher turnover rate among compensation-dissatisfied employees.
## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
If this problem is not addressed, the organization faces serious retention and performance challenges. Our data shows a 34% higher turnover rate among employees dissatisfied with compensation, which creates constant recruiting and training costs. Low job satisfaction leads to declining performance (our data suggests 28% lower goal achievement), absenteeism, and reduced productivity. This directly affects profitability and our ability to compete. Stakeholders and shareholders depend on stable, engaged employees to drive organizational success.

### Stakeholder Impact
• **Employees:** Experience dissatisfaction due to perceived unfair pay (12% gaps) and lack of transparency about compensation decisions, leading to demotivation
• **Managers:** Struggle to retain talent and explain compensation decisions without a clear, transparent system, increasing their stress and workload
• **HR:** Faces ongoing retention challenges and must manage higher recruitment costs from 34% elevated turnover
• **Finance:** Must balance pay equity corrections with budget constraints while seeing ROI from reduced turnover
• **Leadership:** Expects sustained performance and growth, which requires satisfied, motivated employees

### Strategic Alignment
Job satisfaction directly affects our ability to retain top talent, maintain productivity, and achieve organizational goals. If we can't keep employees satisfied through fair, transparent compensation, we can't remain profitable or competitive. Our organizational culture should value employees feeling fairly treated and motivated, which drives the performance and retention we need for long-term success.

## Evidence Questions to Explore
### For the Problem (Step 2)
- What evidence shows this problem exists?
- How widespread is this problem?
- What are the root causes?
• Evidence can be lack of collaboration, absenteeism, we can compare previous work to current work to show performance is declining due to lack of motivation and morale.
• This problem is pretty widespread and you can find lack of motivation at pretty much any company at different levels around the world. In some form you will find someone that isn't motivated for some reason. Studies found under Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace show that 8/10 people feel disconnected from their workplace due to lack of satisfaction
• Root causes for this problem would be different things like: lack of efficient management, no established culture in the workplace, employees feeling like they're not receiving due recognition, poor leadership decisions and lack of decision-making discretion. These causes could even be things like too heavy or light of a workload.
### For the Solution (Step 4)
- What evidence supports compensation transparency as the solution?
- Has this solution worked in similar contexts?
- What are the potential risks and benefits?

**Evidence supporting the solution:**
• Scientific studies (Indonesia N=120, Ghana N=60) show compensation improvements increase motivation, which drives job satisfaction
• Our organizational data shows strong correlation between compensation and satisfaction (r=0.58), and motivation and satisfaction (r=0.71)
• Practitioner evidence shows 15-25% satisfaction improvements with transparent, performance-linked compensation systems
• The mechanism is validated: compensation → motivation → job satisfaction

**Similar context success:**
• Technology, financial services, and professional services sectors report success with transparent, performance-linked compensation
• Companies implementing compensation transparency see 15-25% satisfaction improvements within 6-12 months
• Organizations addressing pay equity see 34% retention improvements

**Risks and benefits:**
• **Benefits:** Higher satisfaction (15-25%), better retention (34%), improved performance (28%), clearer career progression
• **Risks:** Cost of equity corrections, potential for increased social comparison, manager implementation challenges, finance skepticism about ROI
• **Mitigation:** Phased implementation, pilot program, "raising floor not lowering ceiling" messaging, manager training
