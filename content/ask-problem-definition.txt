## PICOC Framework
### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)
Key Affected Groups:
• Employees across all levels
  - All individuals working within the organization can be affected if they are not motivated. This can lead to heavy decline in all productivity
  - Direct effect on daily work experience and performance

• Management and leadership
  - Responsible for implementing and maintaining motivation strategies
  - Must deal with turnover and absenteeism from lack of motivation. Can increase stress having to find replacements and deal with higher-ups of company.

### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Proposed Solutions:
• Compensation and Benefits Enhancement
  - Strategy: Increase workers' compensation and provide performance-based packages
  - Purpose: Create tangible motivation through financial incentives, where they can also find value in the amount of their work output.

• Job Satisfaction Monitoring
  - Implementation: Regular surveys to measure and track job satisfaction
  - Goal: Gather data to identify and address motivation issues effectively, as well as ensure our implementation of workers compensation is working.
### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
If instead we choose to do nothing this will lead to an increase in turnover, and absenteeism. This will also ensure more inefficient work, and lack of optimism/satisfaction at work.
### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
Success in this situation would provide us with happier employees that find satisfaction in their job more, ones that feel appreciated. This will increase efficiency in work output due to need for increased pay. It will also hopefully give us decrease in turnover, as well as surveys that show increased job satisfaction within our organization.
### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
This would apply to situations where the workers morale is generally low. Where workers find it hard to stay motivated in their workplace and their management has unclear strategy or set goals that make it hard for employees to stay satisfied at work. This setting could be one where there is bias in the workplace, overload of work and more.
## Clear Problem Statement
The management problem I want to address is lack of motivation in employees. Employees do not want to come to work, nor do they feel as if it is a place that is doing something for them. They feel as if it is a waste of time and they are a slave to the job. Managers are not effectively putting their employees in a place to thrive and or learn which is essential in assuring motivation within their work.
## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
If this problem is not addressed, firstly the organization will begin to decline as a whole. As it is a managers main job to ensure a workplace where the culture is established and should be one where they do their best to assure worker satisfaction. This issue will lead to the overall downfall in performance, as cannot not move efficiently as a company under these conditions. It will cause workers to skip out from work as well as arrive late. This issue can affect all our stake and shareholders as well being they depend on us to keep the company going in a upward path. Overall it can lead to the overall demise of our company as a whole and put us in a spot where we are fighting to compete.
### Stakeholder Impact
It will affect employees firstly as they are the ones struggling to find lack of motivation coming from management. Also as employees struggle this will lead to downfall in work output which can lead to layoffs. This can affect management as they are under stress trying to keep the company moving forward. This can also affect our higher-ups as they expect our output to remain at a constant rise. They can begin issues with connections within the company and more.
### Strategic Alignment
If workers are not motivated to perform to their highest extent this can affect our mains of making profit and upholding the company's image. We need our workers motivated so we can remain profitable and also so we can uphold what we consider ideal company culture, which shouldn't include workers that aren't fueled to perform to their best.
## Evidence Questions to Explore
### For the Problem (Step 2)
- What evidence shows this problem exists?
- How widespread is this problem?
- What are the root causes?
• Evidence can be lack of collaboration, absenteeism, we can compare previous work to current work to show performance is declining due to lack of motivation and morale.
• This problem is pretty widespread and you can find lack of motivation at pretty much any company at different levels around the world. In some form you will find someone that isn't motivated for some reason. Studies found under Gallup’s State of the Global Workplace show that 8/10 people feel disconnected from their workplace due to lack of satisfaction
• Root causes for this problem would be different things like: lack of efficient management, no established culture in the workplace, employees feeling like their not receiving due recognition, poor leadership decisions and lack of decision-making discretion. These causes could even be things like too heavy or light of a workload.
### For the Solution (Step 4)
- What evidence supports our preferred solution?
- Has this solution worked in similar contexts?
- What are the potential risks and benefits?
• If these workers are able to receive extra compensation and/or benefits for increased performance in their field, this will increase their motivation to work, one they want to earn more money, and two they do not want their co-workers to exceed their input level which can make them look bad. Job satisfaction surveys will also give us the info we need to effectively change what is causing lack of motivation within our company. They will allow us to give and receive feedback throughout all levels of the company, which ultimately should lead to nothing but positive outcomes.
• This solution has worked in big companies such as places like Deloitte and Microsoft. In the case of Deloitte they gave their employees bonuses and increases after they reviewed the performance, this improved their productivity in the company as a whole because the employees wanted more pay as well as a good evaluation. Then, even huge companies such as Google say job satisfaction surveys are a great way to gain information on the organization, and use that to improve company culture, leading to overall better performance.
• Risks that come with this can be burnout, turnover, competition between co-workers leading to trouble. The biggest risk believed to come with this is lack of in-trinsic motivation, as it could lead to workers going harder just for the pay rather than genuinely wanting better for the company.
