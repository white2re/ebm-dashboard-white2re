# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Increased Employee Job Satisfaction (Primary Outcome)
- **Specific:** We will measure whether transparent, performance-linked compensation improvements increase employee job satisfaction scores through enhanced motivation.
- **Measurable:** Track employee satisfaction surveys (1-10 scale) quarterly, comparing pre-implementation baseline to post-implementation results. Target: 15-25% improvement.
- **Achievable:** This target is realistic based on practitioner evidence showing 15-25% satisfaction improvements within 6-12 months from similar compensation interventions.
- **Relevant:** Job satisfaction is our primary outcome (Y in X→M→Y model). Improving satisfaction addresses the core problem of employees not wanting to come to work.
- **Time-bound:** Assess satisfaction improvements at 6-month and 12-month milestones post-implementation.

### Criterion 2: Improved Employee Retention
- **Specific:** Our compensation packages and commitment to better employee satisfaction allow us to retain more workers and keep them satisfied.
- **Measurable:** The HR department keeps data on recent turnover, past turnover, etc. This will allow us to compare our business performance under our solutions vs. prior to implementation.
- **Achievable:** This is realistic as workers will find more value in their workplace, as well as be more motivated to go to work, exceed performance expectations and earn higher pay.
- **Relevant:** Yes, if we are reducing turnover from our solutions that means workers are finding more willingness to come and provide efficient work, which means motivation is being increased.
- **Time-bound:** Analyzing the data quarterly will be efficient for applying changes. This will also allow HR to gather more information over this time period so the results are not stagnant.

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
**Primary Outcome (Y - Job Satisfaction):**
• Job satisfaction scores: Target 15-25% improvement
• Voluntary turnover rates: Target 34% retention improvement among previously dissatisfied employees
• Compensation-related exit reasons: Target 50% reduction

**Mediating Mechanism (M - Motivation):**
• Motivation/engagement scores: Track quarterly to validate X→M pathway
• Performance ratings: Target 28% improvement
• Goal achievement rates: Track quarterly through Performance Management System

**Intervention Implementation:**
• Manager training completion: Target 90%+
• Pay equity corrections: Target completion of identified 12% gaps
• Performance-compensation matrix adoption: Target 100% deployment

### Qualitative Indicators
- Employee feedback on compensation transparency and fairness
- Manager confidence in communicating compensation decisions
- HR assessment of implementation ease
- Stakeholder perceptions of intervention effectiveness

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals - show up first)
**Motivation Indicators (M):**
• Motivation/engagement score increases (3-6 months)
• Performance rating improvements
• Increased participation in discretionary activities
• Improved attendance and punctuality

**Implementation Fidelity:**
• Manager training completion rates
• Performance-compensation matrix adoption
• Pay equity correction progress

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes - show up later)
**Satisfaction Indicators (Y):**
• Job satisfaction score improvements (6-12 months)
• Voluntary turnover rate reductions (12 months)
• Compensation-related exit reason decreases
• Sustained performance improvements

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
**Based on Organizational Data (N=2,847):**

**Primary Outcome Baselines:**
**Metric 1 (Y):** Current job satisfaction scores (from employee survey platform)
**Metric 2 (Y):** Current turnover rate with 34% gap between compensation-satisfied vs. dissatisfied employees
**Metric 3 (Y):** Current compensation-related exit interview mentions

**Mechanism Baselines:**
**Metric 4 (M):** Current motivation/engagement scores (1-5 scale)
**Metric 5 (M):** Current performance ratings and goal achievement rates

**Problem Indicators:**
**Metric 6:** 12% pay equity gaps across similar roles
**Metric 7:** Lack of transparent performance-compensation connection

### Data Collection Plan
We will get our HR department to record and analyze all the employees of the company through satisfaction surveys to gather info for that. Then for things such as turnover rate we should have on file what workers we have lost, how long their tenure was with us etc.

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement (Weak Success)
**Primary Outcomes (Y):**
• Job Satisfaction: 15% improvement
• Retention: 20% improvement among previously dissatisfied employees
• Performance: Measurable goal achievement gains

**Mechanism Validation (M):**
• Motivation scores show measurable increases
• Motivation increases occur BEFORE satisfaction increases (validating X→M→Y)

**Implementation:**
• Manager training completed
• Pay equity corrections implemented
• Performance-compensation matrix deployed

### Target Performance Level (Moderate Success)
**Primary Outcomes (Y):**
• Job Satisfaction: 15-19% improvement
• Retention: 20-29% improvement among previously dissatisfied employees
• Performance: 20-27% goal achievement improvement

**Mechanism Validation (M):**
• Partial validation of X→M→Y pathway
• Motivation increases correlate with satisfaction gains
• Some moderator interference (e.g., economic conditions, manager quality variations)

### Stretch Goal (Strong Success)
**Primary Outcomes (Y):**
• Job Satisfaction: 20-25% improvement
• Retention: 30%+ improvement among previously dissatisfied employees
• Performance: 28%+ goal achievement improvement

**Mechanism Validation (M):**
• Full validation of compensation → motivation → satisfaction pathway
• Clear evidence that compensation improvements → motivation increases → satisfaction gains
• Sustained effects at 12 months
• Minimal moderator interference

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Management Success Measures
• Improved retention (34% gap closure) reduces recruitment and training costs
• Higher performance (28% goal achievement) improves organizational outcomes
• Clear, transparent compensation system reduces manager burden explaining pay decisions
• Validated logic model demonstrates evidence-based decision-making

### Employee Success Measures
• Improved job satisfaction (15-25% increase) means employees want to come to work
• Fair, transparent compensation (12% gap closure) reduces perceived inequity
• Clear performance-pay connection shows employees how their work matters
• Increased motivation leads to better performance and career progression

### HR Success Measures
• Reduced turnover (34% improvement) decreases recruitment workload
• Evidence-based intervention demonstrates HR's strategic value
• Systematic evaluation provides data for continuous improvement
• Successful implementation builds capability for future EBM projects
## Risk Indicators

### Red Flags
• Employee satisfaction surveys are showing decline
• Turnover rate increasing beyond current set baseline 
• Employees are providing us with negative feedback in regard to compensation packages in surveys
• Decline in work quality despite higher compensation
• Signs of employees being unethical in hopes of higher pay throughout the compensation system
• Rise in absenteeism despite new incentives

### Mitigation Triggers
• If satisfaction continues to be low coming from consecutive surveys
• If turnover exceeds 15%
• If unhealthy competition between workers begins to show due to higher compensation
• Employee motivation rates decline more than the average of 20% showing our implementations did nothing.

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
• Implementation and communication of new compensation packages to all employees
• Completion of initial job satisfaction surveys
• Initial feedback on performance-based incentives
• Absenteeism rates
• Setup of performance tracking systems

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
• First quarterly turnover rate analysis
• Completion of second round of satisfaction surveys to see what are the needed changes
• Early signs of performance improvement data
• Employee motivation scores showing initial increases (leading indicator)
• Reduction in absenteeism rates
• Productivity improvements under new system

### Long-term (6-12 months)
• Achievement of 15-25% improvement in employee job satisfaction scores
• Retention improvement of 20-34% among previously dissatisfied employees (targeting the gap closure)
• Performance improvements of 20-28% in goal achievement rates
• Establishment of positive workplace culture around fair compensation
• Development of long-term retention strategies
• Sustained satisfaction and motivation improvements

## Reporting Framework
We will communicate progress by providing feedback to our employees based off what we receive from our surveys. We can hold meetings to ensure they know and understand that our implementations are successful or not.

### Dashboard Metrics
• Daily attendance and punctuality rates
• Performance metrics tied to compensation packages
• Work output
• Number of employees qualifying for increased compensation.
• Ongoing employee satisfaction rate 
• Workplace motivation rate
• Absenteeism rates compared to baseline
• Progress toward compensation package goals
• Employee participation in surveys
• Turnover rate 

### Regular Reports
We will report multiple different metrics such as motivation rate, absenteeism/turnover rates, as well as results that we receive from the satisfaction surveys. We will do this process quarterly.

### Milestone Reviews
We will do our formal assessment after we have received all our quarterly info and can analyze our surveys as well.
