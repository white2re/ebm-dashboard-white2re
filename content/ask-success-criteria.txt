# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Increased workers motivation 
- **Specific:**  We will be measuring how compensation packages can increase worker motivation, as well as how job satisfaction surveys too see if motivation is actually improving.
- **Measurable:**  We will measure progress by taking employee satisfaction surveys, keeping data on turnover rates, as well as if workers seem more motivated from things like showing up on time, providing quality work etc.
- **Achievable:** This solution is very realistic as it is based off multiple different HR strategies that multiple businesses have implemented to improve motivation in employees, as well as many studies from HR cases.
- **Relevant:** It is relevant because the packages will increase motivation which leads to more satisfaction. The surveys directly give us feedback on things such as how we can work towards higher motivation.

### Criterion 2: Reduced turnover
- **Specific:** Our compensations packages and will to better employee satisfaction allow us to retain more workers and keep them satisfied.
- **Measurable:** The HR department keeps data on recent turnover, past turnover, etc. This will allow us to compare our business under our solutions vs prior.
- **Achievable:** This is realistic as workers will find more value in their workplace, as well as be more motivated to go to work, exceed performance and make more pay.
- **Relevant:** Yes, if we are reducing turnover from our solutions that means that workers are finding more will to come and provide efficient work which means motivation is being increase in some way.
- **Time-bound:** I think if we go over the data and analyze it quarterly to apply changes will be efficient. This will also HR to gather up more info over this time period so the results are not as stagnant.

### Criterion 3: Positive satisfaction survey results
- **Specific:** If our workers are saying that they enjoy the new compensation systems, as well as find joy when they are at work. They feel as if they belong and want to give company their best.
- **Measurable:** Going through all the surveys to see what amount of workers say they are satisfied vs the ones that say they do not feel fit in this workplace.
- **Achievable:** Yes if we provide these surveys quarterly, this will be a good enough amount of time to tell if they job satisfaction is improving or declining.
- **Relevant:** Yes job satisfaction is a leading factor when it comes to varying job motivation, being able to find satisfaction is your job ultimately motivates you to give your best. If we receive good results that is more than relevant when it comes to improving motivation.
- **Time-bound:** After the quarterly reviews, a week or two will be needed to go through all the surveys give HR time to effectively analyze them.

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
• Employee satisfaction, we will check the % increase of workers who are more satisfied, 15% improvement deemed successful
• We will measure the quarterly turnover rates, reduce turnover by 10%
• We can have HR keep track of workers who show up on time, early, and late
• We can keep track of productivity, to see if they are actually completing new work under implementations
• Increase in compensation coming from increased work output.

### Qualitative Indicators

- Improved employee engagement
- Enhanced productivity rate
- Increased worker satisfaction
- Increased feeling of value in workplace


### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress)

• More participation
• Higher collaboration in workplace
• Decreased absenteeism rate, workers begin showing up on time.
• Higher productivity and higher work completion

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
• Workplace culture is positive and aligns with companies overall goals
• Job satisfaction surveys are showing the company moving in a positive direction as well as workers find joy in what they do,
• Turnover rate is ultimately decreased by a decent margin.
• Senior management is pleased with how workers are now performing at a higher standard, now that they feel valued.

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics

**Metric 1:** Current Employee satisfaction rate = 65%
**Metric 2:** Current Quarterly Turnover Rate = 12%
**Metric 3:** Current Workplace Motivation Rate = 20% Based on Gallup's State of the Global Workplace data showing 8/10 workers feel disconnected

### Data Collection Plan
We will get our HR department to record and analyze all the employees of the company through satisfaction surveys to gather info for that. Then for things such as turnover rate we should have on file what workers we have lost, how long their tenure was with us etc.

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
• Employee Satisfaction: Increase from 65% to 70%
• Quarterly Turnover Rate: Decrease from 12% to 10%
• Workplace Motivation Rate: Increase from 20% to 30%
• At least 40% of employees reporting positive feedback about new the company's new compensation packages

### Target Performance Level
• Employee Satisfaction: Increase to 80%
• Quarterly Turnover Rate: Reduce to somewhere between 7-8%
• Workplace Motivation Rate: Increase to 40%
• At least 70% of employees reporting improved job satisfaction in quarterly surveys
• At least 80% on-time arrival rate
• 70% of employees improving their performance due to new compensation packages

### Stretch Goal
• Employee Satisfaction: Reach 90%
• Quarterly Turnover Rate: Reduce to 5% or lower
• Workplace Motivation Rate: Reach 50% or higher
• 90% of workers improve performance due to compensation packages
• • At least 85% of employees reporting improved job satisfaction in quarterly surveys

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

• Improved productivity rate from performance-based compensation
• Positive workplace culture that helps aligns with company goals
• Reduction in absenteeism and late arrivals if any at all
• Higher quality work output due to more motivated employees

## Risk Indicators

### Red Flags
• Employee satisfaction surveys are showing decline
• Turnover rate increasing beyond current set baseline 
• Employees are providing us with negative feedback in regard to compensation packages in surveys
• Decline in work quality despite higher compensation
• Signs of employees being unethical in hopes of higher pay throughout the compensation system
• Rise in absenteeism despite new incentives

### Mitigation Triggers
• If satisfaction continues to be low coming from consecutive surveys
• If turnover exceeds 15%
• If unhealthy competition between workers begins to show due to higher compensation
• Employee motivation rates decline more than the average of 20% showing our implementations did nothing.

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30-90 days)
• Implementation and communication of new compensation packages to all employees
• Completion of initial job satisfaction surveys
• Initial feedback on performance-based incentives
• Absenteeism rates
• Setup of performance tracking systems

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
• First quarterly turnover rate analysis (aiming for reduction to 10%)
• Completion of second round of satisfaction surveys to see what are the needed changes
• Clear performance improvement data
• Employee satisfaction trending toward 70% target
• Workplace motivation improving from 20% baseline to one that continues to build on our solution effectiveness
• Reduction in absenteeism rates
• Productivity under new system

### Long-term (6-12 months)
• Achievement of 15% improvement in employee satisfaction
• Turnover rate stabilized at target 7-8%
• Workplace motivation rate reaching target 40%
• Establishment of positive workplace culture
• Development of long-term retention strategies
• At least 70% of employees showing improved performance

## Reporting Framework
We will communicate progress by providing feedback to our employees based off what we receive from our surveys. We can hold meetings to ensure they know and understand that our implementations are successful or not.

### Dashboard Metrics
• Daily attendance and punctuality rates
• Performance metrics tied to compensation packages
• Work output
• Number of employees qualifying for increased compensation.
• Ongoing employee satisfaction rate 
• Workplace motivation rate
• Absenteeism rates compared to baseline
• Progress toward compensation package goals
• Employee participation in surveys
• Turnover rate 

### Regular Reports
We will report multiple different metrics such as motivation rate, absenteeism/turnover rates, as well as results that we receive from the satisfaction surveys. We will do this process quarterly.

### Milestone Reviews
We will do our formal assessment after we have received all our quarterly info and can analyze our surveys as well.
