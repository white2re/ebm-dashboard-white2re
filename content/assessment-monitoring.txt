# Assessment: Monitoring & Evaluation Plan

---

## Logic Model (X → M → Y)

### X (Intervention): What Will Be Implemented?
The intervention has three main parts:
1. **Transparent Performance-Compensation Matrix:** A clear system that shows employees how their performance ratings connect to their pay
2. **Pay Equity Corrections:** Fix the 12% pay gaps we found between employees in similar roles
3. **Performance-Linked Review System:** Regular reviews with trained managers who can give fair evaluations

### M (Mechanism): How/Why Should It Work?
The intervention should work by increasing employee motivation. When people can see a clear link between their work and their pay, they feel more motivated. Fair pay also reduces feelings of unfairness that hurt motivation. Regular reviews keep motivation up through ongoing feedback.

The evidence supports this: studies from Indonesia (N=120) and Ghana (N=60) show motivation is the key link between compensation and satisfaction. Our organizational data (N=2,847) shows motivation and satisfaction are strongly correlated (r=0.71), and compensation explains 31% of motivation differences.

### Y (Outcome): What Results Are Expected?
Based on the evidence I reviewed, I expect:
- **Job satisfaction** to increase by 15-25%
- **Retention** to improve by 34% among employees who were previously dissatisfied with pay
- **Performance** (measured by goal achievement) to improve by 28%

I'll check that the pathway works by looking at whether motivation increases first (X→M), then whether those motivation increases lead to satisfaction improvements (M→Y)

## Evaluation Design

### Evaluation Question
Did the compensation transparency intervention increase job satisfaction through improved motivation?

### Comparison Approach: Before-and-After Design
I'll use a simple before-and-after comparison to see if the intervention worked:

**Before (Baseline):**
- Measure satisfaction, motivation, turnover, and performance using data already in our systems (N=2,847 employees)
- The organization already collects this through HRIS, employee surveys, and performance systems

**After (Post-Intervention):**
- Measure the same things after the intervention is implemented
- Compare the results to baseline to see what changed

This design is practical because it uses existing data systems and doesn't disrupt normal operations.

### Outcome Measures
**Job Satisfaction (main outcome):**
- Employee survey scores (1-10 scale)
- Turnover rates
- Exit interview reasons related to compensation

**Motivation (mediator):**
- Employee motivation/engagement scores (1-5 scale)
- Performance ratings
- Goal achievement rates

### How I'll Rule Out Alternative Explanations
Several other things could affect satisfaction besides my intervention:

1. **Other HR programs** - I'll track what other initiatives are happening and compare satisfaction changes on compensation-specific questions vs. general satisfaction
2. **Industry trends** - I'll compare our results to industry benchmarks (GSS data) to see if we're doing better than average
3. **People quitting** - I'll track who leaves during implementation to make sure improving satisfaction isn't just because unhappy people already left
4. **Survey bias** - I'll use actual behavior data (turnover, performance) not just survey responses to confirm real changes

## Implementation Fidelity

### Content: What Must Be Implemented?

**Component 1: Performance-Compensation Matrix**
This needs to clearly show employees how their performance connects to their pay. It should be easy to understand, applied the same way across all departments, and cover all job types.

**Component 2: Pay Equity Corrections**
We need to fix the 12% pay gaps identified in the organizational data. This means doing an audit, making corrections based on objective criteria (tenure, performance, market rates), and communicating clearly about the changes.

**Component 3: Review System & Manager Training**
Managers need training on how to do fair evaluations and communicate about compensation. Then they need to actually use the new system in employee reviews.

### Dose: How Much Is Needed?

For the intervention to work, managers must complete the training and all three components (matrix, equity corrections, reviews) must be actually implemented and used—not just created but sitting unused.

### Moderators: What Might Make It More or Less Effective?

**Manager Quality:** Better managers who are good at fair evaluations and clear communication will probably get better results. If some managers struggle, they'll need extra support.

**Finance Support:** If finance doesn't approve the full budget, we might have to do a scaled-down version which could weaken the impact.

**Economic Context:** If there's a recession or high inflation (currently at 4.1% vs. our 3.2% raises), compensation might matter even more to employees.

**Organizational Culture:** Organizations that are already open and transparent will adopt this easier than organizations with more secretive cultures.

**Employee Tenure:** Long-tenured employees (4+ years) who have seen a 22% satisfaction drop might need additional career development support, not just compensation fixes.
