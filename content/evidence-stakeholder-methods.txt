# Stakeholder Evidence: Methods & Engagement Strategy
**Logic Model:** Compensation → Motivation → Job Satisfaction

## Goals for Stakeholder Evidence
**Primary Goal:** Understand how different stakeholder groups see and experience issues with employee motivation and job satisfaction, especially related to compensation
**Secondary Goal:** Gather feedback on how feasible compensation interventions might be, the level of support, and potential challenges to implementation

## Target Stakeholders

### Internal Stakeholders
#### Primary Internal Stakeholders
- **Senior Leadership:** CEO, VP of HR, and Department Directors – their perspective matters for strategic priorities, budgets, and how ready the organization is for change
- **Middle Management:** Team leads and project managers – can share insights on how compensation affects employee motivation from a supervisory viewpoint
- **Employees/Staff:** Individual contributors across departments – their direct experiences reveal how current compensation impacts motivation and satisfaction

#### Secondary Internal Stakeholders  
- **HR Personnel:** Compensation analysts, talent management staff – technical experts on the systems and what's realistic to implement
- **Finance/Operations:** Budget owners and operational managers – provide input on resource allocation and cost considerations

### External Stakeholders
#### Primary External Stakeholders
- **Industry Competitors:** Other companies competing for the same talent – help benchmark compensation practices and standards
- **Professional Networks:** Industry associations and professional societies – provide insight on broader trends and best practices

#### Secondary External Stakeholders
- **Recruiters & Staffing Agencies:** Offer market insights on talent retention and compensation competitiveness
- **Organizational Development Consultants:** External experts who have experience implementing compensation systems

## Where Stakeholder Evidence Comes From

### Internal Sources
- **Engagement Surveys:** Annual engagement data, exit interviews, pulse surveys – especially feedback about pay and motivation
- **Performance Reviews:** Manager observations on employee motivation, goal achievement, and career development patterns
- **Internal Communications:** Town halls, suggestion systems, and internal survey responses related to pay satisfaction
- **HR Analytics:** Turnover rates by compensation level, internal mobility, and correlations between performance ratings and pay
- **Management Reports:** Leadership discussions on retention, budgeting, and strategic HR planning

### External Sources  
- **Industry Reports:** Benchmark studies, association surveys on compensation and motivation trends
- **Company Public Communications:** Annual reports, investor presentations, press releases about HR initiatives
- **Professional Networks:** LinkedIn, industry forums, and conference presentations on compensation topics
- **Third-Party Surveys:** Glassdoor, Best Places to Work surveys, and other industry-wide compensation data
- **Competitive Intelligence:** Public info on competitor compensation programs and talent strategies

## Power/Interest Analysis

### High Power, High Interest (Manage Closely)
- **Senior Leadership:** CEO, VP of HR – ultimate decision-makers, set budgets, drive strategic priorities
- **Department Directors:** Manage teams, control budgets for pay changes, oversee implementation

### High Power, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)  
- **Finance Leadership:** Approve budgets but may not prioritize HR initiatives without clear ROI
- **Board Members/Investors:** Oversight role, generally focused more on finances than HR specifics

### Low Power, High Interest (Keep Informed)
- **Employees:** Directly affected by compensation changes but have little decision power
- **Middle Management:** Interested in team motivation solutions but limited authority
- **HR Staff:** Knowledgeable and invested but lack executive decision-making authority

### Low Power, Low Interest (Monitor)
- **External Recruiters:** Can provide market insight but limited stake in internal decisions  
- **Industry Associations:** General interest in best practices but no direct influence over company policies

## How Stakeholder Evidence Will Be Gathered

Since this project is primarily about collecting secondary evidence, we'll rely on existing internal data (surveys, performance reviews, HR analytics) and publicly available information (industry reports, company publications, third-party surveys). This method helps gather insights efficiently without requiring direct consultation with stakeholders.

The power/interest analysis also helps prioritize whose perspectives matter most—focusing on high-power stakeholders (like senior leadership and finance) who ultimately decide whether compensation changes can happen and how resources are allocated.
