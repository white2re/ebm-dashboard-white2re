## Access and Permissions

### Data Access Strategy
#### Required Permissions
- **Data Custodians:** HR Director (HRIS, payroll, survey data), Finance Director (compensation budgets)
- **Approval Process:** Written request to HR for employee data access, , data sharing agreements with IT department
- **Privacy Considerations:** Employee data anonymization required, no individual identification in reports, GDPR/privacy law compliance, restricted access to compensation details
- **Confidentiality Requirements:** Non-disclosure agreements for internal data, data security protocols, limited sharing scope for academic/research purposes only

#### Contact Plan
1. **Primary Contact:** HR Director 
   - **Data Sources:** Employee satisfaction surveys, turnover data, performance ratings, compensation records, HRIS data
   - **Approach:** Formal written request emphasizing research on how compensation affects job satisfaction

2. **Secondary Contact:** Finance/Compensation Director 
   - **Data Sources:** Payroll data, compensation budgets, salary benchmarking, ROI metrics
   - **Approach:** Schedule meeting to discuss research objectives, emphasize strategic value for organization, request of data



### Ethical Considerations
- **Employee Privacy:** Anonymize all individual records, use employee IDs instead of names, aggregate data for analysis (minimum group size of 10), no individual compensation details in reports
- **Data Security:** Encrypted storage for all data files, secure VPN access only, password-protected documents, limited data retention period so will delete after research completion
- **Use Limitations:** Data used solely for academic research on compensation-motivation-satisfaction relationships, no commercial use, no sharing info with anyone, no individual performance evaluations
- **Reporting Boundaries:** Report aggregate trends only, no individual or small group identification, benchmark against GSS national dataset, focus on organizational patterns not personal details

## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Pre-Problem Baselines
Before issues with compensation, employee motivation and job satisfaction are likely going to be at normal. Employees are generally engaged with their work, and satisfied with their pay, turnover will be low.
#### Normal Operating Ranges

Normal performance would be when the  employees are reasonably motivated, satisfied with their amount of pay at their job, they are completing tasks on time, and staying connected to organization goals.
Abnormal performance would be when motivation or satisfaction drops — employees become disengaged, begin complaining about pay fairness, their productivity begins to decline, or turnover starts to rises above normal levels.

#### Benchmark Comparisons
**GSS National Benchmarks (2024 data):**
- **Job Satisfaction:** Compare organizational satisfaction scores against GSS national average (~70-75% of workers report being "very satisfied" or "somewhat satisfied" with their jobs)
- **Pay Satisfaction:** Benchmark against GSS findings that ~60-65% of workers feel their pay is "about right" compared to others doing similar work
- **Work Motivation:** Compare engagement scores against GSS data showing ~45-50% of workers report finding their work "very rewarding"

**Historical Internal Targets:**
- Pre-2020 satisfaction levels as baseline (before we had COVID hit)
- Turnover rates during stable periods
- Previous compensation outcomes and how employees respondede 

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators
[What data would confirm the problem exists?]
:Employees reporting dissatisfaction with pay, raises, or bonuses in satisfaction surveys
:High turnover with multiple workers saying pay is the reason
:Negative feedback in exit interviews or engagement surveys mentioning compensation
:Differences in pay equity across similar roles leading to frustration or disengagement

#### Problem Severity Measurement
**Quantitative Severity Indicators:**
- **Satisfaction Gap:** Calculate percentage points below GSS national benchmarks: GSS 60-65% benchmark 
- **Engagement Score Decline:** Measure percentage drop in motivation/engagement scores over time periods when compensation issues emerge

#### Root Cause Investigation
-Correlating employee motivation or engagement scores with pay levels, raises, or bonuses
-Comparing pay fairness perceptions across different employee groups or roles
-Examining turnover or intent-to-leave rates in relation to pay changes or lack of raises
-Reviewing exit interview feedback or survey comments that mention compensation
-Analyzing whether employees in similar roles with similar responsibilities are paid differently, which may indicate fairness issues

### Solution Feasibility Analysis
#### Resource Assessment
**Financial Capacity Analysis:**
- **Compensation Budget Availability:** Review annual budget allocations for salary increases, bonuses, and benefits improvements
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Compare cost of compensation improvements against potential savings from reduced turnover and increased productivity
- **ROI Historical Data:** Analyze past compensation initiatives return on investment using productivity and retention metrics
- **Market Position:** Compare current compensation spending as percentage of revenue against GSS industry benchmarks



#### Risk Assessment
**Implementation Risk Factors:**
- **Budget Constraints:** Analyze financial projections to identify potential budget shortfalls that could limit compensation improvements
- **Equity Risks:** Review demographic data to ensure compensation changes don't create new fairness issues or legal compliance problems
- **Competitive Response:** Use GSS and market data to evaluate if compensation improvements might trigger retention issues with competitors

## Documentation Strategy

### Data Collection Log
**Systematic Tracking Approach:**
- **Data Collection Spreadsheet:** Track date collected, data source, variables included, time period covered, and data quality notes
- **GSS Comparison Log:** Document which GSS variables correspond to what we found at company
- **Update Schedule:** Monthly log of new data additions, quarterly reviews of data completeness against research goals

### Analysis Documentation
**Comprehensive Analysis Records:**
- **Methodology Documentation:** Record statistical methods used
- **Findings Log:** Document key insights from compensation → motivation → job satisfaction pathway analysis with supporting data
- **GSS Benchmark Comparisons:** Maintain detailed comparison tables showing organizational performance against GSS national averages
- **Trend Analysis Reports:** Regular documentation of changes in key metrics over time, linking to compensation

### Quality Assurance
**Data Validation Procedures:**
- **Cross-System Verification:** Validate compensation data across HRIS, payroll, and performance systems for consistency
- **GSS Methodology Alignment:** Ensure internal survey questions and analysis methods align with GSS standards for valid comparisons


## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
**Potential Access Limitations:**
- **Sensitive Compensation Data:** Individual salary details may be restricted due to privacy policies or legal requirements
- **Historical Data Gaps:** Older satisfaction survey data or performance records may not be archived in accessible formats
- **System Integration Issues:** Data may be spread across different systems (HRIS, payroll, performance) making the integration difficult

### Data Quality Issues
**Common Data Problems:**
- **Survey Response Bias:** Low response rates or no participation in satisfaction surveys affecting validity
- **Inconsistent Data Entry:** Variations in how compensation, performance, or satisfaction data is recorded across systems

### Access Barriers
**Organizational Obstacles:**
- **Privacy Policies:** Strict HR policies may limit access to employee data even for research purposes
- **IT Security Restrictions:** System access controls may prevent data extraction or have strict approval process
- **Management Reluctance:** Leadership may be hesitant to share sensitive compensation or performance data for analysis

### Time Constraints
**Timeline Challenges:**
- **Approval Processes:** Data access requests may require weeks or months for approvals through HR, legal, and IT departments
- **System Availability:** IT resources for data extraction may be limited during busy periods or system maintenance windows
- **Survey Scheduling:** Employee satisfaction surveys may only be conducted annually, limiting data collection timing

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
**Backup Data Options:**
- **Public Records:** Use publicly available compensation data from other data sets for benchmarking like Federal employee viewpoint survey
- **Anonymous Surveys:** Conduct voluntary anonymous surveys if formal HR data is inaccessible
- **Manager Interviews:** Gather qualitative insights from management about compensation-motivation relationships

### Proxy Measures
**Substitute Indicators:**
- **Turnover Rates as Satisfaction Proxy:** Use voluntary turnover rates by pay level as indicator of compensation satisfaction
- **Productivity Metrics as Motivation Proxy:** Use performance ratings, goal completion rates, or output measures as motivation indicators
- **Absenteeism as Engagement Proxy:** Track attendance patterns as measure of employee engagement and job satisfaction
- **Internal Mobility as Opportunity Satisfaction:** Monitor promotion rates and internal job changes as career satisfaction measure

**Essential Evidence Requirements:**
- **Core GSS Comparison:** At minimum, compare organizational satisfaction levels against GSS national benchmarks for validation
- **Basic Correlation Analysis:** Establish simple correlation between compensation levels and turnover rates to gain info about job satisfaction and to test logic model
- **Trend Analysis:** Track satisfaction/engagement trends over time
- **Key Stakeholder Feedback:** Gather qualitative insights from HR leadership and managers about compensation-satisfaction relationships

### Simplified Analysis
"The GSS national dataset supports a positive relationship between compensation satisfaction and job satisfaction, with approximately 60-65% of workers who feel fairly compensated also reporting higher job satisfaction levels. Our organizational evidence framework, aligned with GSS methodology, provides multiple data sources (HRIS, performance systems, engagement surveys) to test whether employee motivation mediates this relationship through measurable indicators like performance ratings and goal achievement. However, alternative explanations including direct compensation effects, management quality, and industry factors should be considered as competing or complementary mechanisms in the compensation-satisfaction pathway."
