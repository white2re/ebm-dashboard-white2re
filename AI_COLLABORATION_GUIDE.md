## 💡 Effective AI Prompting Strategy

### 🎯 The Golden Rule
**Always end major requests with:**
*"Before you respond, ask me several questions that will enhance the quality of your response."*

This ensures the AI understands your specific context and needs.

### 📋 Prompt Structure Template

```
CONTEXT: I'm a MGT357 student working on an Evidence-Based Management dashboard project.

CURRENT SITUATION: [Describe what you're working on]

SPECIFIC REQUEST: [What you need help with]

CONSTRAINTS: [Any limitations or requirements]

DESIRED OUTCOME: [What success looks like]

Before you respond, ask me several questions that will enhance the quality of your response.
```

### ✅ Example: Good Prompt for Evidence Analysis

```
CONTEXT: I'm analyzing practitioner evidence for my EBM dashboard about employee retention in small businesses.

CURRENT SITUATION: I've found 3 case studies from Harvard Business Review and 2 industry reports, but I'm struggling to evaluate their credibility and relevance.

SPECIFIC REQUEST: Help me create a systematic approach to appraise this practitioner evidence using EBM principles.

CONSTRAINTS: Must align with OLI Module content on evidence evaluation. Should result in clear quality ratings.

DESIRED OUTCOME: A structured evaluation framework I can apply to any practitioner evidence, with specific assessments of my current sources.

Before you respond, ask me several questions that will enhance the quality of your response.
```

4. Ask for the help you need

### 🔄 Maintaining Context
**Throughout the conversation:**
- Reference previous discussions: "Earlier you helped me with..."
- Provide updates: "Since our last chat, I've completed..."
- Build on prior work: "Building on the framework you suggested..."

### 🎯 Staying Focused
**Keep conversations productive:**
- One main topic per conversation
- Use specific examples from your project
- Ask for concrete next steps
- Request feedback on your work

## 🛠️ Technical Collaboration Patterns

### 📝 Content Development Workflow

1. **Start with structure**: "Help me outline the main sections for [evidence type]"
2. **Develop content**: "Now help me write detailed content for section X"
3. **Refine quality**: "Review this content and suggest improvements"
4. **Format properly**: "Format this for my dashboard content file"

### 🔧 Technical Problem Solving

1. **Describe the issue**: "My dashboard isn't showing updated content"
2. **Share context**: "I edited the .txt file but the dashboard still shows old content"
3. **Get systematic help**: "Walk me through troubleshooting steps"
4. **Verify solution**: "Help me test that this fix worked"

### 🎨 Customization Support

1. **Express your vision**: "I want my dashboard to look more professional"
2. **Get specific suggestions**: "What color schemes work well for business dashboards?"
3. **Implementation help**: "Show me how to change the colors in my CSS"
4. **Quality check**: "Does this look professional enough for a portfolio?"

## 🎓 Learning Mindset

### 🤔 Ask for Explanations
**Don't just accept solutions - understand them:**
- "Can you explain why this approach works?"
- "What are the key principles behind this recommendation?"
- "How does this connect to Evidence-Based Management theory?"

### 🔍 Seek Patterns
**Look for transferable knowledge:**
- "What's the general pattern I can apply to similar problems?"
- "How would this approach work for different types of evidence?"
- "What are the underlying frameworks I should remember?"

### 🎯 Practice Application
**Apply learning immediately:**
- "Now let me try this approach with my next evidence source"
- "Can you review how I applied what you taught me?"
- "What would you do differently in my specific situation?"
